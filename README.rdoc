Getting Started With Rails
==========================

My files here follow the [Getting Started With Rails] 
(http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) guide from ```rubyonrails.org```.  The tutorial introduces the basics of a Rails application including installation, set-up, database connection, the general layout of a Rails application, and basic principles of "Model, View, Controller" design.  A basic blog is created.
